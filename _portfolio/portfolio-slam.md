## Problem
Traditional SLAM systems struggle in highly dynamic environments (e.g., moving people/vehicles).

## Solution
Integrated **YOLO** object detection into the **ORB-SLAM3** pipeline to semantically mask dynamic features. Developed a novel evaluation framework to separately assess localization drift and object tracking trajectory.

## Result
Significantly improved localization stability and provided a dual-stream output of ego-motion and object tracking.

**Keywords:** ROS, ORB-SLAM3, YOLO, C++, Python
